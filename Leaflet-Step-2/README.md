# Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Background

![1-Logo](Images/1-Logo.png)

In this work, I built a new set of tools that visualize earthquake data to educate the public and other government organizations on issues facing our planet. 

The data set included with the work is based on data collected from [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) The USGS collects a massive amount of data from all over the world each day. In fact, the USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. I used the dataset - 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days'  for this work in JSON format. 


### The Visualization

### Task

Your first task is to visualize an earthquake data set.

1. **Get the data set**

   ![4-JSON](Images/4-JSON.png)
   

2. **Import & Visualize the Data**

   Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.

   * Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * Create a legend that provides context for your map data.


3.  **Get the second data set**

* Plot the second data set on the map illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.
Data on tectonic plates is found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>.

* Add a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out our two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.

* Add layer controls to our map.

  * See what it looks like.
